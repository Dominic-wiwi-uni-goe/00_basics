### (2) Some basic commands in R

##### As for basic commands that you need to know when using RStudio:

- Clear console: `Ctrl + L`
- Quit RStudio: `Ctrl + Q` or `quit()`
- Run code from the script: `Ctrl + Enter`
- Remove saved variable: `remove()`
- Clear everything in the workspace: `remove(list = ls())`
- Access previous command: `Arrow up`
- R awaits the next command: `>`
- R is expecting more inputs: `+`
- Comment / uncomment code in script: `Ctrl + Shift + C`
- Getting help: `help()` or `?`

##### Basic arithmetic and variable assignment
One of the most basic use cases of R is basic arithmetic. Moreover, you can also assign values to variables in order to make your calculations more flexible and robust.

- Add: `+`
- Subtract: `-`
- Multiply: `*`
- Divide: `/`
- Power: `^` or `**`
- Integer divide: `%/%`
- Modulo (remainder after division): `%%`
- Variable assignment: `=` or `<-`

#####Comparison and logical operators
Comparison operators compare a pair of values and return either a true or a false.

- Equal to: `==` (note the difference between ==, which is used for comparison and =, which is used for assignment)
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

Logical operators, on the other hand, are used to combine multiple true and false statements.
- And: `&`
- Or: `|`
